Some of my notes from the Year 1 Programming for Engineers module, taught at Imperial College London, in the Electrical and Electronic Engineering course.
I have omitted my notes from Autumn term, as they consisted mostly of a syntactical introduction to C++. 
I have also omitted the 3 projects we undertook throughout the year as end of term assessments, as we were instructed by the module leader to keep those private.
For reference, the autumn term assessment was focused on reading from and outputting to files, manipulating vectors and control flow.
The spring term assessment consisted of various manipulations on a tree where each node had an arbitrary number of child nodes. 
The summer term assessment was constructing a decision tree from an input file, then using it to determine outcomes.
