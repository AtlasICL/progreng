These are some of my exercises from the year 1 Programming for Engineers module.  

### Assessments

The **autumn** term assessment was focused on input/output to files, basic data structures, and control flow.
The **spring** term assessment consisted of various manipulations on a tree where each node had an arbitrary number of child nodes. 
The **summer** term assessment was constructing a decision tree from an input file, and processing queries.
